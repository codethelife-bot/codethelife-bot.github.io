<h2 id="wall-bricks">the "wall" pieces</h2>
<p>these are good for making houses, spaceships cockpits, and walls.
<h3>the 1x1 brick</h3>
<p>this brick is good for filling in spaces in walls, making colloums, and more. This tiny brick can fit in the smallest places.</p>
<h3>the 2x1 brick</h3>
<p>this brick is better than the 1x1 brick in making a good wall because it can have two bricks under it and lock them together, where as a 1x1 brick cannot. the 2x2 brick, however is not as small, and can't fit into small spaces as well.</p>
<h3>the 4x1 brick</h3>
<p>this may be the most commonly used wall brick. it is not that small, but is very useful in other ways. for example, it is commonly used to make fences, or even doors. it is also long enough to connect 2 bricks under it, so it makes for sturdy building.</p>
<h3>the 6x1, 8x1, 10x1, and 12x1</h3>
<p>these bricks all do one thing: making sturdy walls. these are long and make nice walls, althouh you cannot use them near corners. these help you walls look very <em>nice</em>.
<h2 id="thick-brick">the thick guys</h2>
<h3>the 2x2 brick</h3>
<p>this brick can be used to make sturdyer colloums. it can also make good tables, boxes, and other cube-like things.</p>
<h3>the 2x4 brick</h3>
<p>this is a very usful brick and is 2 are often use to make big tables. they are also used for thick walls or cliffs.</p>
<h3>the 2x6, 2x8, 2x10, and 2x12 bricks</h3> 
<p>these all have almost no uses. it can be used to make a bench or somthing like that.</p>

<h2 id="flat-dude">the flat ones</h2>
<p>these are good if you cant find the right <a href="#wall-bricks">wall</a> or <a href="#thick-brick">thick</a> bricks.
